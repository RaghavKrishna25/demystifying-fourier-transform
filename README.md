# Demystifying the Fourier Transform: From Time to Frequency

This repository contains MATLAB codes and example scripts that demonstrate key concepts of the Fourier Transform. It complements my Medium article:

[Demystifying the Fourier Transform: From Time to Frequency](https://medium.com/@RaghavKrishna25/demystifying-the-fourier-transform-from-time-to-frequency-dba82f371466)

The codes are organized into folders by topic to help you explore specific aspects easily.

Feel free to clone and try the scripts in MATLAB.  
For detailed explanations and theory, please refer to the article above.
